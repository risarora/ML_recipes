ROC
  The ROC curve can also help debug a model. For example, if the bottom left corner of the curve is closer to the random line, it implies that the model is misclassifying at Y=0. Whereas, if it is random on the top right, it implies the errors are occurring at Y=1. Also, if there are spikes on the curve (as opposed to being smooth), it implies the model is not stable. When dealing with fraud models, ROC is your best friend.
