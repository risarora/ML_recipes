Estimates of Variability

Deviations
	The difference between the observed values and the estimate of location.
	errors, residuals

Variance
	The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n – 1 where n is the number of data values.
	mean-squared-error

Standard deviation
	The square root of the variance.
	l2-norm, Euclidean norm

Mean absolute deviation
	The mean of the absolute value of the deviations from the mean.
	l1-norm, Manhattan norm

Median absolute deviation from the median
	The median of the absolute value of the deviations from the median.

Range
	The difference between the largest and the smallest value in a data set.

Order statistics
	Metrics based on the data values sorted from smallest to biggest.
	ranks


Exploring the Data Distribution
Boxplot
	A plot introduced by Tukey as a quick way to visualize the distribution of data.
Box and whiskers plot
Frequency table
	A tally of the count of numeric data values that fall into a set of intervals (bins).
Histogram
	A plot of the frequency table with the bins on the x-axis and the count (or proportion) on the yaxis.
Density plot
	A smoothed version of the histogram, often based on a kernal density estimate.

EXPLORING CATEGORICAL DATA
Mode
	The most commonly occurring category or value in a data set.
Expected value
	When the categories can be associated with a numeric value, this gives an average value based on a category’s probability of occurrence.
Bar charts
	The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as bars.
Pie charts
	The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as wedges in a pie.



Correlation

Correlation coefficient
A metric that measures the extent to which numeric variables are associated with one another
(ranges from –1 to +1).
Correlation matrix
A table where the variables are shown on both rows and columns, and the cell values are the
correlations between the variables.
Scatterplot
A plot in which the x-axis is the value of one variable, and the y-axis the value of another.


Exploring Two or More Variables

Contingency tables
A tally of counts between two or more categorical variables.
Hexagonal binning
A plot of two numeric variables with the records binned into hexagons.
Contour plots
A plot showing the density of two numeric variables like a topographical map.
Violin plots
Similar to a boxplot but showing the density estimate.
