# Cross Validation 
We need cross validation for 
* accessing model quality and reliability 
* hyper-parameter tuning
* model selection
* feature engineering

K-Fold Strartified Validation


#### Common types of cross-validation
1. Exhaustive cross-validation
 * Leave-p-out cross-validation
 * Leave-one-out cross-validation
2. Non-exhaustive cross-validation
 * k-fold cross-validation
 * Holdout method
 * Repeated random sub-sampling validation (a.k.a Monte Carlo cross-validation)
