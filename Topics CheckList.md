### Intro
This is a data science study guide that you can use to help prepare yourself for your interview. This was developed by people who have interviewed and gotten jobs at Amazon| Facebook| Capital One and several other tech companies. We hope these help you get great jobs as well.
In order to use this, you can make a copy of this sheet and follow along with the study guide. Keeping track helps you know where you are and how you are doing.

x|Probability And Statistics| |||
x|A common question you might get at FAANG companies and other tech companies alike is the occasional probability or statistics question. The questions won’t necessarily require complex math. However| if you haven’t thought about independent and dependent probabilities in while. It is good to review setting up the basic formulas.| |||

x|Product And Experiment Designs| |||
x|Product sense is an important skill for data scientists. Knowing what to measure on new products and why can help determine whether a product is doing well or not. The funny thing is| sometimes metrics going the way you want them to might not always be good. Sometimes the reason people are spending more time on your website is because webpages might be taking longer to load or other similar problems. This is why metrics are tricky and what you measure is important.| |||

x|Product And Metrics Questions| |||
x|| |||
x|An important metric goes down| how would you dig into the causes?| |||
x|What metrics would you use to quantify the success of youtube ads (this could also be extended to other products like Snapchat filters| twitter live-streaming| fort-nite new features| etc)| |||
x|How do you measure the success or failure of a product/product feature| |||
x|Google has released a new version of their search algorithm| for which they used A/B testing. During the testing process| engineers realized that the new algorithm was not implemented correctly and returned less relevant results. Two things happened during testing:| |||
x|People in the treatment group performed more queries than the control group.| |||
x|Advertising revenue was higher in the treatment group as well.| |||
x|| |||
x|What may be the cause of people in the treatment group performing more searches than the control group? There are different possible answers here.| |||
x|| |||
x|Question 4 borrowed from Zarantech|https://www.zarantech.com/blog/interview-questions/data-science-product-analysis-and-business-metrics-interview-questions/ |||
x|| |||
x|Programming| |||
x|Just because data science doesn't always require heavy programming| it doesn't mean that interviewers won't ask you traverse a binary tree. So make sure you ask your interviewer what to expect. Don't be daunted by these questions. Pick a few to do just so you're not surprised in an interview.| |||
